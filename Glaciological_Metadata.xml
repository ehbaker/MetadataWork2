      <abstract>Since the late 1950s, the USGS has maintained a long-term glacier mass-balance program at three North American glaciers. Measurements began on South Cascade Glacier, WA in 1958, expanding to Gulkana and Wolverine glaciers, AK in 1966, and later Sperry Glacier, MT in 2005. Additional measurements have been made on Lemon Creek and Taku glaciers, AK to compliment data collected by the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP; Pelto et al., 2013). Direct field measurements of point glaciological data are combined with weather and geodetic data to derive glacier-wide seasonal and annual surface mass balance solutions of each glacier in conventional and reference surface formats (Cogley et al., 2011). Additional details on the calculation of glacier-wide surface mass balance is described in Van Beusekom et al. (2010).</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this project is to quantitatively record changes in mass at specified glaciers over the period of record. Although this data was primarily collected for the purpose of mass balance, there are many other potential uses for this data, including ecological assessments, remote sensing validation, or water resource applications. Data is included as available, though the history of the project. Additional older, undigitized records may be available via digitized scans of field notebooks.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data is used to calculate seasonal glacier-wide mass balances, as released in O'Neel et. al (2016): https://doi.org/10.5066/F7HD7SRF.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Snowpits:
Samples of snow and ice have been taken with a variety of samplers through the history of the project, as described in the "sampler" column metadata. Sample weight and depth below surface are noted. Weight is measured using a spring scale, and small stuff sack for the sample. Sample depth is taken with a tape measurer in pits, or measured along core, and in coring hole.

Snowdepth:
Snowdepth is measured by probing undisturbed snow near an ablation stake, or measured in a snow pit or snow core where ice is reached. Strike of the probe against the ice surface can generally be felt. These depths should be used with some caution, and in conjunction with snow depths measured at ablation stakes, as ice lenses within the snowpack may occasionally be mistaken for the glacier surface. In a pit or snow core, the glacier surface is obvious.

Ablation Stake Measurements:
Metal stakes are installed vertically into the glacier surface at index sites with the use of a steam drill. Stake is labeled with the year in which it is installed, and with marked length increments. Upon subsequent visits to the site, level of snow or ice on the stake is recorded. The absolute value of measurements of stake above surface or below surface are not meaningful. Rather, the change in length above and below surface give either depth of snow accumulation or melt during the interval between measurements. Stakes are labeled with the index site name, and year in which the stake was installed. Stakes are measured for multiple years. They are initially installed up-glacier from the absolute position of the index site, and flow through the site in following years. A single year of measurements at a single index site will comprise measurements from multiple stakes, thereby giving a more representative picture of the mass balance at that site.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>This dataset contains point raw glaciological field data. Snow pit and snow core data gives detailed information on snow density through the measured snow column. Snow depth measurements are collected via snow probe and in some snow pits or snow cores that extend the full depth of the snowpack to the glacier's surface. Ablation stakes allow point measurement of both snow depth and snow melt against the reference of the labeled stake. Draw wires provide additional measurements of snow and ice melt, against the invariant reference of the labeled wire.
Files are named according to the following conventions:
pitcore folder:
Each pit or pit/core combination measurement is presented as a separate csv. They are named as
Glacier_YYYY_MM_DD_TypeOfMeasurement (pit or core or combination)_IndexSiteName.csv

snowdepth folder:
All years and sites combined into single file.

stake folder:
All stakes that exist at a single index site are combined into a single file. These are named as Glacier_IndexSiteName_raw_stake_data.csv.</eaover>
