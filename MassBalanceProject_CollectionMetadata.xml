      <abstract>Since the late 1950s the late 1950s, the USGS has maintained a long-term glacier mass-balance program at three North American glaciers. Measurements began on South Cascade Glacier, WA in 1958, expanding to Gulkana and Wolverine glaciers, AK in 1966, and later Sperry Glacier, MT in 2005. Additional measurements have been made on Lemon Creek and Taku glaciers, AK to compliment data collected by the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP; Pelto et al., 2013). Direct field measurements of point glaciological data are combined with weather and geodetic data to derive glacier-wide seasonal and annual surface mass balance solutions of each glacier in conventional and reference surface formats (Cogley et al., 2011). Additional details on the calculation of glacier-wide surface mass balance is described in Van Beusekom et al. (2010).</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this project is to quantitatively record changes in mass at specified glaciers over the period of record. Although this data was primarily collected for the purpose of mass balance, there are many other potential uses for this data, including ecological assessments, remote sensing validation, or water resource applications. Data is included as available, though the history of the project. Additional older, undigitized records may be available via digitized scans of field notebooks.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data release is composed of the varied datasets used by the USGS Benchmark Glacier program to measure seasonal and annual mass balance. Products within the release range frow raw field data to processed glacier-wide mass balance measurements. </supplinf>
